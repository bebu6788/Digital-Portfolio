Climbing is my life passion. Since I was a 13 year old kid, I was hooked by the concept of a sport that allowed for limitless potential for progression and improvement. In bouldering there will always be something harder, and you can always get stronger! The second you send your hardest boulder, you're already thinking about the next. This loop of dedicating days and days into a single project until you finish it, just to do it all over again on something newer and more difficult is a mindset that has proven valuable in many aspects of life.

Music has always been a huge part of my life, offering an outlet for creativity and fulfillment that constantly challenges my thinking. Through music, I have had endless opportunities for learning and self improvement. It's something that I can get lost in like nothing else around me exists, time stops, and I can be fully present in. From playing Steely Dan on the piano and Radiohead on the guitar, to writing songs of my own, the lessons learned along the way have proved valuable teaching many things about motivation, commitment, and discipline.
