Projects:

"Soccer Party" is a dynamic, Mario Party-inspired game coded in C++. Players navigate through a series of challenges and mini-games, reminiscent of classic party-style gaming. With engaging move-based mechanics, participants compete in soccer-themed activities, fostering a fun and competitive atmosphere. The project showcases proficiency in C++ programming, incorporating object-oriented principles for game design and development. It demonstrates creativity in adapting traditional gaming concepts into an interactive and entertaining experience, highlighting both technical skill and imaginative game design prowess.

"Games" is a comprehensive Java project incorporating various object-oriented techniques to create a multi-game application featuring Blackjack, Connect 4, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Through the implementation of object-oriented principles, each game offers a unique and immersive experience for players. The Blackjack module challenges players' strategic thinking and decision-making, while Connect 4 tests their spatial reasoning and tactical skills. Meanwhile, Tic-Tac-Toe provides a classic and enjoyable diversion. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in Java programming but also showcases versatility in designing and integrating multiple games within a single application, enriching the user experience.

"Climbing Game" created in C++, where player interaction is facilitated through cin for input. In this game, players select their climbers and embark on climbing adventures, accompanied by the ability to purchase essential gear such as shoes, chalk, and other equipment. Through cin console commands, users navigate the game world, scaling various virtual cliffs and conquering challenges along the way.  This was my first ever project in CSICI 1300

"Robotics Grocery Store Project", where we've managed to get a robot to navigate a superstore autonomously using dynamic vision and machine learning. The video showcases the robot's remarkable ability to recognize and retrieve each cube with precision, utilizing advanced odometry techniques for seamless navigation. Witness firsthand as our robot maneuvers through the store!

"Pac-Man Game" developed in C++, incorporating multiple design patterns to deliver an immersive gaming experience. Players control pacman by collecting pellets, activating power-ups, and strategically eliminating ghosts to progress towards victory. Through the application of design patterns such as Singleton for managing game state, Factory for generating game entities, and Observer for ghost behavior, this project showcases advanced software engineering principles. With each strategic move, players are immersed in a nostalgic Pac-Man adventure, highlighting both technical proficiency and creative game design expertise.
