The goal of this application is to create a website that combines social media and reading. Here, we will allow users to register and create a unique profile where they discuss books they have read and are currently reading. They can also put a short description about themselves and what genres they enjoy. This will allow other users to see their page and find inspiration for different books to read. If you have friends on the platform, you will also be able to recommend books to read based on their interests.
This will help people find books they would have otherwise never thought about reading. It will encourage discussion, be a one-stop-shop for finding books to read, and also keep track of books you currently own. With the variety of different forms that books currently exist in, it can be pretty difficult to keep track of which book you own in what form and. if online, what website. We would also like to add an inventory section that would make the users life easier by keeping track of their “library”, what form the book is in, whether it be physical, digital, or audio, and where they currently have the book. On top of creating a social aspect when it comes to reading, this will also make the users lives much easier and make reading much more accessible.

To view the website navigate to the `All Project Code Components` folder and `docker-compose up`.
